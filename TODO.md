## Week One Requirements

- [x] Open a new version of your online IDE
- [x] Print a message to the user that welcomes them to your application
- [x] Prompt the user for their name
- [x] Create a variable that will hold the user’s name. For now, you can assign a value to the name, next week we will learn how to get the user’s input for this requirement
- [x] Prompt the user with a welcome message that greets them by name and asks them from which of the two options would they like to travel: Mexico or Jamaica
    - [x] You are free to use any two countries of your choice
- [x] Copy your finished code and add it to a new GitHub repository

## Week two Requirements
- [x] Open your VacationBudgetPlanner that you began last week
- [x] Refactor: After the line that asks for the user’s name, refactor the variable you created for the user’s name and allow the user to input their name into that variable
- [x] Now, the welcome message that greets the user by name and asks them where they would like to travel should use the name that the user input.
- [x] For now, we are going to build out the application for Jamaica. So the user should type in Jamaica and move to the next line
- [x] Once the user Chooses Jamaica as their destination, ask the user how many days they will spend on the trip? Allow the user to write this and store it in a variable
- [x] Ask the user how much “spending money” they would like to bring? Allow the user to write this and store it in a variable
- [x] Calculate how much spending money the user has per day on the trip 


## Putting It All Together

## Section 1: The Setup

-[x] Print to the console “Welcome to the Vacation Budget Planner!”
-[x] Print to the console “What is your name?”
-[x] Store the user’s input into the appropriate variable
-[x] Concatenate a string that welcomes the user by name and asks them to choose a place to travel
-[x] Print another line to the console that reads “Choose (1) Mexico (2) Jamaica ”
-[x] Store the user’s input into the appropriate variable



# Section 2: The Options
- [x] We will use a switch statement to build out the two different flows in this application. In Case 1 the user will have calculations based on the Peso. In Case 2 the user will have calculations based on the Jamaican Dollar
- [x] Create a Switch statement that switches on the users choice of Mexico or Jamaica
- [x] Create two skeletons for two Cases with a break 
- [x] Create a default statement in case a user does not choose Mexico or Jamaica that lets the user know they must choose either Mexico or Jamaica



# Section 3: The Mexico Flow

- [x] In this section, we will work to build out the flow if a user chooses to visit the country of Mexico
- [x] Print a line to the Console that reads “Great, Mexico sounds like an amazing trip!”
- [x] Print a line that will just be used for formatting purposes that looks like 
- [x] Ask the user how many days do they plan spending in Mexico
- [x] Store the user’s input into the appropriate variable
- [x] Ask the user how much money in USD do they plan to spend on the trip
- [x] Store the user’s input into the appropriate variable
- [x] Calculate the number of total hours the user will have on their trip and store it in a variable
- [x] Calculate the number of total minutes the user will have on their trip and store it in a variable
- [x] Concatenate a string that breaks down the duration of their trip in hours and in minutes
- [x] Calculate the amount of money the user has to spend per day based on their trip duration and the money they said they were planning to spend and store it in a variable
- [x] Calculate the conversion of dollars into peso (may have to do research) and store it in a variable
- [x] Calculate the number of pesos they will have available to spend each day and store it in a variable
- [x] Research how to get the message that prints to the Console to only show up to two decimal places.
- [x] Print a message to the user that informs them of the amount they plan to spend in USD and how much that will be divided into the number of days they plan to spend on the trip
- [x] Use your research to display only two decimal points
- [x] Print a similar message that breaks this down, converted into pesos
- [x] Use the df2.format() method to display only two decimal points
- [x] Finally, print a message that tells the user to enjoy their trip 


## Code Exercise 4: The Jamaican Flow 

In this section, you will work to build out the flow if a user chooses to visit the country of Jamaica. 
Using the Mexico flow as a frame of reference, in Case 2 you will add a very similar flow that calculates based on the Jamaican Dollar.

## Challenge: Do It Again
Currently, the application does not give the user the option to try again. Refactor your code to give the user the option to run through the entire application again.
Give the user the option to run through the application again. 
If the user chooses “no” end the application
